    "Often, sampling frames are not available for the sampling units of interest. For example, most countries do not have a list of all households or people living in the country. Even if such frames exist, it may not be operationally and financially feasible to directly select sampling units without any form of clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, stage sampling is a common strategy used by large household national surveys for selecting samples of households and people. At the first stage, geographic or administrative clusters of households are selected. At the second stage, a frame of households is created from the selected clusters and a sample of households is selected. At the third stage (if applicable), a sample of people is selected from the households in the sample. This is a high level description of the process; usually implementations are much less straightforward and may require many adjustments to address complexities. "

    "At the first stage, we use the proportional to size (pps) method to select a random sample of clusters. The measure of size is the number of households (number_households) as provided in the psu sampling frame. The sample is stratified by region. The probabilities, for stratified pps, is obtained as follow: \\begin{equation} p_{hi} = \\frac{n_h M_{hi}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}{M_{hi}}} \\end{equation} where $p_{hi}$ is the probability of selection for unit $i$ from stratum $h$, $M_{hi}$ is the measure of size (mos), $n_h$ and $N_h$ are the sample size and the total number of clusters in stratum $h$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important.** The pps method is used in many surveys not just for multistage household surveys. For example, in business surveys, establishments can greatly vary in size; hence pps methods are often use to select samples. Simarly, facility-based surveys can benefit from pps methods when frames with measures of size are available. "
