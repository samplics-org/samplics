Users should expect some APIs to change significantly in 0.4.x. This phase will be completed by January 2023.\nThe next minor version 0.5.x will be much more stable and the focus will be on the regression and SAE modules.\nIf you would like to support the projet visit https://github.com/sponsors/samplics\n\n\n\nIn large scale surveys, often complex random mechanisms are used to select samples. Estimations obtained from such samples must reflect the random mechanism to ensure accurate calculations. samplics implements a set of sampling techniques for complex survey designs.\nSampling. Since the full population cannot be observed, a sample is selected to estimate population parameters of interest. The assumption is that the sample is representative of the population for the characteristics of interest. The sample size calculation and selection methods in samplics are:\n\nSample size calculation and allocation: Wald and Fleiss methods for proportions.\nEqual probability of selection: simple random sampling (SRS) and systematic selection (SYS)\nProbability proportional to size (PPS): Systematic, Brewer’s method, Hanurav-Vijayan method, Murphy’s method, and Rao-Sampford’s method.\n\nSample weighting. Sample weighting is the main mechanism used in surveys to formalize the representivity of the sample. The design/base weights are usually adjusted to compensate for distortions due nonresponse and other shortcomings of the the sampling design implementation.\n\nWeight adjustment due to nonresponse\nWeight poststratification, calibration and normalization\nWeight replication i.e. Bootstrap, BRR, and Jackknife\n\nPopulation parameters estimation. The estimation of the parameters of interest must reflect the sampling mechanism and the weight adjustments.\n\nTaylor-based procedures\nReplication-based estimation i.e. Boostrap, BRR, and Jackknife\nRegression-based e.g. generalized regression (GREG)\n\nCategorical data analysis. The estimation of the parameters of interest must reflect the sampling mechanism and the weight adjustments.\n\nOne-way and two-way tabulation\nT-test including Rao-Scott adjustment\n\nSmall Area Estimation (SAE). When the sample size is not large enough to produce reliable / stable domain level estimates, SAE techniques can be used to model the output variable of interest to produce domain level estimates.\nContact Information  Mamadou S.

    "text": "The Unit Level model refers to a class of SAE techniques that fit the linear mixed model at the sampling unit level. As for the Area Level model, generalized linear mixed models are also the modeling framework for Unit Level model. In this case, given that the model is happening at the sub-area level, both the random effects and unit level standard errors can be estimated from the model. In this tutorial, we will predict the area level means which is a linear parameter.\n\n\nFor this example, we use the county crop data used by Battese, Harter, and Fuller (1988). The datasets contains 37 observations on areas under corn and under soybeans for each of the 12 counties in the north-central of Iowa. Each county was divided in segments and using interviews and LANDSAT satellite data, data on area used for corn and soybeans was obtained. In the unit level data, each observation is a segment with the following variables: county id (county_id), area in hectare under corn (corn_area), area in heactare under soybeans (soybeans_area), number of pixel classified as corn (corn_pixel), and number of pixels classified as soybeans (soybeans_pixel).\n\nfrom samplics.datasets import load_county_crop, load_county_crop_means\nfrom samplics.sae import EblupUnitModel\n\n\n# Load County Crop sample data\ncountycrop_dict = load_county_crop()\ncountycrop = countycrop_dict[\"data\"]\n\nprint(\"First observations from the unit (segment) level crop areas data\")\ncountycrop.head(15)\n\nFirst observations from the unit (segment) level crop areas data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      county_id\n      corn_area\n      soybeans_area\n      corn_pixel\n      soybeans_pixel\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      165.76\n      8.09\n      374\n      55\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      96.32\n      106.03\n      209\n      218\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      76.08\n      103.60\n      253\n      250\n    \n    \n      3\n      4\n      185.35\n      6.47\n      432\n      96\n    \n    \n      4\n      4\n      116.43\n      63.82\n      367\n      178\n    \n    \n      5\n      5\n      162.08\n      43.50\n      361\n      137\n    \n    \n      6\n      5\n      152.04\n      71.43\n      288\n      206\n    \n    \n      7\n      5\n      161.75\n      42.49\n      369\n      165\n    \n    \n      8\n      6\n      92.88\n      105.26\n      206\n      218\n    \n    \n      9\n      6\n      149.94\n      76.49\n      316\n      221\n    \n    \n      10\n      6\n      64.75\n      174.34\n      145\n      338\n    \n    \n      11\n      7\n      127.07\n      95.67\n      355\n      128\n    \n    \n      12\n      7\n      133.55\n      76.57\n      295\n      147\n    \n    \n      13\n      7\n      77.70\n      93.48\n      223\n      204\n    \n    \n      14\n      8\n      206.39\n      37.84\n      459\n      77\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the unit (segment) level data, we have the small area (county) level averages of the number of pixels classified as corn or soybeans.\n\n# Load County Crop Area Means sample data\ncountycropmeans_dict = load_county_crop_means()\ncountycrop_means = countycropmeans_dict[\"data\"]\n\nprint(f\"County level crop areas averages\")\ncountycrop_means.head(15)\n\nCounty level crop areas averages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      county_id\n      samp_segments\n      pop_segments\n      ave_corn_pixel\n      ave_soybeans_pixel\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      545\n      295.29\n      189.70\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      1\n      566\n      300.40\n      196.65\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      1\n      394\n      289.60\n      205.28\n    \n    \n      3\n      4\n      2\n      424\n      290.74\n      220.22\n    \n    \n      4\n      5\n      3\n      564\n      318.21\n      188.06\n    \n    \n      5\n      6\n      3\n      570\n      257.17\n      247.13\n    \n    \n      6\n      7\n      3\n      402\n      291.77\n      185.37\n    \n    \n      7\n      8\n      3\n      567\n      301.26\n      221.36\n    \n    \n      8\n      9\n      4\n      687\n      262.17\n      247.09\n    \n    \n      9\n      10\n      5\n      569\n      314.28\n      198.66\n    \n    \n      10\n      11\n      5\n      965\n      298.65\n      204.61\n    \n    \n      11\n      12\n      6\n      556\n      325.99\n      177.05\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we are going to estimates the average area size under corn and soybeans.

    "text": "Small area estimation (SAE) are useful techniques when the sample sizes are not sufficient to provide reliable direct domain estimates given the sampling design. In this tutorial, the direct estimates refer to estimates obtained from the design-based approach. It usually consists of applying adjusted design weights to the variable of interest to compute sample parameters as estimates of equivalent population parameters. When auxiliary information is available, we can use model assisted survey methods can be used to estimate population parameters.\nIn this tutorial, we will go futher and use modeling techniques to produce domains estimates. For the area level model, the modeling is done at the area level using generalized linear mixed models. The sections below shows how to use the EblupAreaModel class from the samplics package to produce area level estimates.\n\n\nTo illustrate the EblupAreaModel class, we will use the Milk Expenditure dataset used in Rao and Molina (2015). As mentioned in the book, this dataset was originally used by Arora and Lahiri (1997) and later by You and Chapman (2006). For the R users, this dataset is also used by the R package sae (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sae/index.html).\nThe Milk Expenditure data contains 43 observations on the average expenditure on fresh milk for the year 1989. The datasets has the following values: major area representing (major_area), small area (small_area), sample size (samp_size), direct survey estimates of average expenditure (direct_est), standard error of the direct estimate (std_error), and coefficient of variation of the direct estimates (coef_variance).\n\nfrom samplics.datasets import load_expenditure_milk\nfrom samplics.sae import EblupAreaModel\n\n\n# Load Expenditure on Milk sample data\nmilk_exp_dict = load_expenditure_milk()\nmilk_exp = milk_exp_dict[\"data\"]\n\nnb_obs = 15\nprint(f\"First {nb_obs} observations of the Milk Expendure dataset\\n\")\nmilk_exp.tail(nb_obs)\n\nFirst 15 observations of the Milk Expendure dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      major_area\n      small_area\n      samp_size\n      direct_est\n      std_error\n      coef_var\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      28\n      4\n      29\n      238\n      0.796\n      0.106\n      0.133\n    \n    \n      29\n      4\n      30\n      207\n      0.565\n      0.089\n      0.158\n    \n    \n      30\n      4\n      31\n      165\n      0.886\n      0.225\n      0.254\n    \n    \n      31\n      4\n      32\n      153\n      0.952\n      0.205\n      0.215\n    \n    \n      32\n      4\n      33\n      210\n      0.807\n      0.119\n      0.147\n    \n    \n      33\n      4\n      34\n      383\n      0.582\n      0.067\n      0.115\n    \n    \n      34\n      4\n      35\n      255\n      0.684\n      0.106\n      0.155\n    \n    \n      35\n      4\n      36\n      226\n      0.787\n      0.126\n      0.160\n    \n    \n      36\n      4\n      37\n      224\n      0.440\n      0.092\n      0.209\n    \n    \n      37\n      4\n      38\n      212\n      0.759\n      0.132\n      0.174\n    \n    \n      38\n      4\n      39\n      211\n      0.770\n      0.100\n      0.130\n    \n    \n      39\n      4\n      40\n      179\n      0.800\n      0.113\n      0.141\n    \n    \n      40\n      4\n      41\n      312\n      0.756\n      0.083\n      0.110\n    \n    \n      41\n      4\n      42\n      241\n      0.865\n      0.121\n      0.140\n    \n    \n      42\n      4\n      43\n      205\n      0.640\n      0.129\n      0.202\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the milk expenditure datasets, some of the coefficients of variation are not small which indicates unstability of the direct survey estimates. Hence, we can try to reduce the variability of the estimates by smoothing them through modeling. For illustration purpose, we will model the average expenditure on milk using the major areas as auxiliary variables.\nFirst, we use the method fit() to estimate the model parameters. The pandas’s method get_dummies() create a matrix with dummy values (0 and 1) from the categorical variable major_area.\n\narea = milk_exp[\"small_area\"]\nyhat = milk_exp[\"direct_est\"]\n\nimport pandas as pd\nX = pd.get_dummies(milk_exp[\"major_area\"],drop_first=True)\nsigma_e = milk_exp[\"std_error\"]\n\n## REML method\nfh_model_reml = EblupAreaModel(method=\"REML\")\nfh_model_reml.fit(\n    yhat=yhat, X=X, area=area, error_std=sigma_e, intercept=True, tol=1e-8,\n)\n\n\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\nprint(f\"The estimated fixed effects are:\") \npprint(fh_model_reml.fixed_effects)\n\nThe estimated fixed effects are:\narray([ 0.96818899,  0.13278031,  0.22694622, -0.24130104])\n\n\n\nprint(\"The estimated standard error of the area random effects is:\")\npprint(fh_model_reml.re_std)\n\nThe estimated standard error of the area random effects is:\n0.13619961509121215\n\n\n\nprint(\"The convergence statistics are:\")\npprint(fh_model_reml.convergence)\n\nThe convergence statistics are:\n{'achieved': True, 'iterations': 7, 'precision': 4.849039732246485e-09}\n\n\n\nprint(\"The goodness of fit statistics are:\") \npprint(fh_model_reml.goodness)\n\nThe goodness of fit statistics are:\n{'AIC': 30.80694883102754,\n 'BIC': 41.37414952518891,\n 'loglike': -9.40347441551377}\n\n\n\nfh_model_reml.predict(\n    X=X, area=area, intercept=True\n)\n\npprint(fh_model_reml.area_est)\n\n{1: 1.0219705448470267,\n 2: 1.047601951883294,\n 3: 1.0679514268850938,\n 4: 0.7608165634164004,\n 5: 0.8461570426977273,\n 6: 0.9743727062092651,\n 7: 1.058452673285536,\n 8: 1.097776256442316,\n 9: 1.2215454913423587,\n 10: 1.1951460164712606,\n 11: 0.7852149170863967,\n 12: 1.2139462074222362,\n 13: 1.2096597223605197,\n 14: 0.9834964402356496,\n 15: 1.1864247095350087,\n 16: 1.155698113523358,\n 17: 1.2263412510186897,\n 18: 1.2856489898727415,\n 19: 1.2363248413266223,\n 20: 1.2349601399238859,\n 21: 1.0903016265233836,\n 22: 1.1923057228469682,\n 23: 1.1216467660137077,\n 24: 1.2230297222963111,\n 25: 1.1938054444127773,\n 26: 0.7627195900552476,\n 27: 0.7649551536523858,\n 28: 0.7338443883489099,\n 29: 0.7699295545743624,\n 30: 0.6134416227081898,\n 31: 0.7695560730689726,\n 32: 0.7958253128224173,\n 33: 0.7723188482183632,\n 34: 0.6102300678743073,\n 35: 0.7001781895145354,\n 36: 0.7592788108093529,\n 37: 0.5298863352267296,\n 38: 0.7434466782997071,\n 39: 0.75489963338527,\n 40: 0.7701919661644314,\n 41: 0.7481164240189863,\n 42: 0.8040775166023048,\n 43: 0.6810868846993623}\n\n\nWe can use the utility method to_dataframe() to output the estimates as a pandas dataframe. The function provides the area, the estimate and its MSE estimates. We can use col_names to customize the name of the columns.

For the simulation, assume that the psu frame was obtained from a previous census conducted several years before. We also assume that, the change in the number of households since the previous census follows a normal distribution with a mean equal to 5% higher than the census value and a variance of 0.15 times the number of households from the census. Under these assumptions, we generate the following second stage frame of households.

However, in strata 10, 16, 29, and 64, we listed more households than during than the census. And finally, we found less households in the remaining clusters than the census.\nNow that we have a second stage frame, let’s use samplics to calculate the probabilities of selection and to select a sample. The second stage sample size is 150 households and the strategy is to select 15 households per cluster.\n\nSSU (household) Probability of Selection\nThe second stage probabilities of selection are conditional on the first stage realization. For this stage, simple random selection (srs) and systematic selection(sys) are common methods used to select households. For this example, we use srs to select 15 households from each cluster. Conditionally to teh first stage, the second stage selection is a stratified srs where the clusters are the strata. More generally, we have that \\[\\begin{equation} p_{hij} = \\frac{m_{hi}}{M_{hi}^{'}} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(p_{hij}\\) is the conditional probability of selection for unit \\(j\\) from stratum \\(h\\) and cluster \\(j\\), \\(m_{hi}\\) and \\(M_{hi}^{'}\\) are the sample size and the number of secondary sampling units listed for stratum \\(h\\) and cluster \\(j\\), respectively.\nIn this scenario, sample size is the same in each stratum. Hence, the parameter sample_size does not need to be a Python dictionary; we will only provide 15 in the function call.\n\nstage2_design = SampleSelection(\n    method=SelectMethod.srs, strat=True, wr=False\n)\n\nssu_frame[\"ssu_prob\"] = stage2_design.inclusion_probs(\n    ssu_frame[\"household\"], 15, ssu_frame[\"cluster\"]\n)\n\nssu_frame.sample(20)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      cluster\n      region\n      household\n      ssu_prob\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1438\n      34\n      East\n      34164\n      0.062762\n    \n    \n      2517\n      52\n      East\n      52606\n      0.024194\n    \n    \n      2943\n      86\n      West\n      86111\n      0.054745\n    \n    \n      3002\n      86\n      West\n      86170\n      0.054745\n    \n    \n      559\n      10\n      North\n      10430\n      0.022727\n    \n    \n      1216\n      29\n      South\n      29159\n      0.069124\n    \n    \n      2751\n      64\n      West\n      64220\n      0.049834\n    \n    \n      412\n      10\n      North\n      10283\n      0.022727\n    \n    \n      2549\n      64\n      West\n      6418\n      0.049834\n    \n    \n      1508\n      34\n      East\n      34234\n      0.062762\n    \n    \n      1517\n      45\n      East\n      454\n      0.037688\n    \n    \n      2658\n      64\n      West\n      64127\n      0.049834\n    \n    \n      1072\n      29\n      South\n      2915\n      0.069124\n    \n    \n      1074\n      29\n      South\n      2917\n      0.069124\n    \n    \n      1669\n      45\n      East\n      45156\n      0.037688\n    \n    \n      1286\n      34\n      East\n      3412\n      0.062762\n    \n    \n      1162\n      29\n      South\n      29105\n      0.069124\n    \n    \n      1051\n      24\n      South\n      2467\n      0.205479\n    \n    \n      3085\n      86\n      West\n      86253\n      0.054745\n    \n    \n      2148\n      52\n      East\n      52237\n      0.024194\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nSSU (household) Selection\nThe second stage sample is selected from the SSU frame (ssu_frame) using the variable cluster as the strat variable.

In the example below, the user is testing whether the average mpg is equal to 20. Hence, the null hypothesis is H0: mean(mpg) = 20. There are three possible alternatives for this null hypotheses:\n\nHa: mean(mpg) < 20 (less_than alternative)\nHa: mean(mpg) > 20 (greater_than alternative)\nHa: mean(mpg) != 20 (not_equal alternative)\n\nAll three alternatives are automatically computed by the method compare().

Similarly, stderror, stddev, lower_ci, and upper_ci provide the standard error, standard deviation, lower bound confidence interval (CI), and upper bound CI, respectively.

The groups are then threated as independent replicates of the the sample design. A special case is when the sample is split into two half samples in each stratum. This design is suitable to many survey designs where only two psus are selected by stratum. In practice, one of the psu is asigned to the first random group and the other psu is assign to the second group. The sample weights are double for one group (say the first one) and the sample weights in the other group are set to zero. To ensure that the replicates are independent, we use hadamard matrices to assign the random groups.\n\nimport scipy\nscipy.linalg.hadamard(8)\n\narray([[ 1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1],\n       [ 1, -1,  1, -1,  1, -1,  1, -1],\n       [ 1,  1, -1, -1,  1,  1, -1, -1],\n       [ 1, -1, -1,  1,  1, -1, -1,  1],\n       [ 1,  1,  1,  1, -1, -1, -1, -1],\n       [ 1, -1,  1, -1, -1,  1, -1,  1],\n       [ 1,  1, -1, -1, -1, -1,  1,  1],\n       [ 1, -1, -1,  1, -1,  1,  1, -1]])\n\n\nIn our example, we have 10 psus. If we do not have explicit stratification then replicate() will group the clusters into 5 strata (2 per stratum). In this case, the smallest number of replicates possible using the hadamard matrix is 8.\nThe result below shows that replicate() created 5 strata by grouping clusters 7 and 10 in the first stratum, clusters 16 and 24 in the second stratum, and so on. We can achieve the same result by providing setting strat=True and providing the stratum variable to replicate().\n\nbrr = ReplicateWeight(method=\"brr\", strat=False)\nbrr_wgt = brr.replicate(\n    samp_weight=full_sample[\"design_weight\"], \n    psu=full_sample[\"cluster\"]\n    )\n\nbrr_wgt.drop_duplicates().head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      _stratum\n      _psu\n      _samp_weight\n      _brr_wgt_1\n      _brr_wgt_2\n      _brr_wgt_3\n      _brr_wgt_4\n      _brr_wgt_5\n      _brr_wgt_6\n      _brr_wgt_7\n      _brr_wgt_8\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      7\n      46.166667\n      0.000000\n      92.333333\n      0.000000\n      92.333333\n      0.000000\n      92.333333\n      0.000000\n      92.333333\n    \n    \n      15\n      1\n      10\n      50.783333\n      101.566667\n      0.000000\n      101.566667\n      0.000000\n      101.566667\n      0.000000\n      101.566667\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      30\n      2\n      16\n      62.149123\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      124.298246\n      124.298246\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      124.298246\n      124.298246\n    \n    \n      45\n      2\n      24\n      58.940741\n      117.881481\n      117.881481\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      117.881481\n      117.881481\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      60\n      3\n      29\n      65.702778\n      0.000000\n      131.405556\n      131.405556\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      131.405556\n      131.405556\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      75\n      3\n      34\n      75.661566\n      151.323133\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      151.323133\n      151.323133\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      151.323133\n    \n    \n      90\n      4\n      45\n      85.398025\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      170.796049\n      170.796049\n      170.796049\n      170.796049\n    \n    \n      105\n      4\n      52\n      85.520635\n      171.041270\n      171.041270\n      171.041270\n      171.041270\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      120\n      5\n      64\n      218.893889\n      0.000000\n      437.787778\n      0.000000\n      437.787778\n      437.787778\n      0.000000\n      437.787778\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      135\n      5\n      86\n      213.491667\n      426.983333\n      0.000000\n      426.983333\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      426.983333\n      0.000000\n      426.983333\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nAn extension of BRR is the Fay’s method. In the Fay’s approach, instead of multiplying one half-sample by zero, we multiple the sampel weights by a factor \\(\\alpha\\) and the other halh-sample by \\(2-\\alpha\\). We refer to \\(\\alpha\\) as the fay coefficient. Note that when \\(\\alpha=0\\) then teh Fay’s method reduces to BRR.\n\nfay = ReplicateWeight(method=\"brr\", strat=False, fay_coef=0.3)\nfay_wgt = fay.replicate(\n    samp_weight=full_sample[\"design_weight\"], \n    psu=full_sample[\"cluster\"], \n    rep_prefix=\"fay_weight_\",\n    psu_varname=\"cluster\", \n    str_varname=\"stratum\"\n)\n\nfay_wgt.drop_duplicates().head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      stratum\n      cluster\n      _samp_weight\n      fay_weight_1\n      fay_weight_2\n      fay_weight_3\n      fay_weight_4\n      fay_weight_5\n      fay_weight_6\n      fay_weight_7\n      fay_weight_8\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      7\n      46.166667\n      13.850000\n      78.483333\n      13.850000\n      78.483333\n      13.850000\n      78.483333\n      13.850000\n      78.483333\n    \n    \n      15\n      1\n      10\n      50.783333\n      86.331667\n      15.235000\n      86.331667\n      15.235000\n      86.331667\n      15.235000\n      86.331667\n      15.235000\n    \n    \n      30\n      2\n      16\n      62.149123\n      18.644737\n      18.644737\n      105.653509\n      105.653509\n      18.644737\n      18.644737\n      105.653509\n      105.653509\n    \n    \n      45\n      2\n      24\n      58.940741\n      100.199259\n      100.199259\n      17.682222\n      17.682222\n      100.199259\n      100.199259\n      17.682222\n      17.682222\n    \n    \n      60\n      3\n      29\n      65.702778\n      19.710833\n      111.694722\n      111.694722\n      19.710833\n      19.710833\n      111.694722\n      111.694722\n      19.710833\n    \n    \n      75\n      3\n      34\n      75.661566\n      128.624663\n      22.698470\n      22.698470\n      128.624663\n      128.624663\n      22.698470\n      22.698470\n      128.624663\n    \n    \n      90\n      4\n      45\n      85.398025\n      25.619407\n      25.619407\n      25.619407\n      25.619407\n      145.176642\n      145.176642\n      145.176642\n      145.176642\n    \n    \n      105\n      4\n      52\n      85.520635\n      145.385079\n      145.385079\n      145.385079\n      145.385079\n      25.656190\n      25.656190\n      25.656190\n      25.656190\n    \n    \n      120\n      5\n      64\n      218.893889\n      65.668167\n      372.119611\n      65.668167\n      372.119611\n      372.119611\n      65.668167\n      372.119611\n      65.668167\n    \n    \n      135\n      5\n      86\n      213.491667\n      362.935833\n      64.047500\n      362.935833\n      64.047500\n      64.047500\n      362.935833\n      64.047500\n      362.935833\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFor any of the three methods, we can request the replicate coefficient instead of the replicate weights by using rep_coefs=True.\n\n\n\n#fay = ReplicateWeight(method=\"brr\", strat=False, fay_coef=0.3)\nfay_wgt = fay.replicate(\n    samp_weight=full_sample[\"design_weight\"], \n    psu=full_sample[\"cluster\"], \n    rep_prefix=\"fay_weight_\",\n    psu_varname=\"cluster\", \n    str_varname=\"stratum\",\n    rep_coefs=True\n)\n\nfay_wgt.drop_duplicates().head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      stratum\n      cluster\n      _samp_weight\n      fay_weight_1\n      fay_weight_2\n      fay_weight_3\n      fay_weight_4\n      fay_weight_5\n      fay_weight_6\n      fay_weight_7\n      fay_weight_8\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      7\n      46.166667\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      1.7\n    \n    \n      15\n      1\n      10\n      50.783333\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      0.3\n    \n    \n      30\n      2\n      16\n      62.149123\n      0.3\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      1.7\n    \n    \n      45\n      2\n      24\n      58.940741\n      1.7\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      0.3\n    \n    \n      60\n      3\n      29\n      65.702778\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      1.7\n      0.3\n    \n    \n      75\n      3\n      34\n      75.661566\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      0.3\n      1.7\n    \n    \n      90\n      4\n      45\n      85.398025\n      0.3\n      0.3\n      0.3\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      1.7\n      1.7\n      1.7\n    \n    \n      105\n      4\n      52\n      85.520635\n      1.7\n      1.7\n      1.7\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      0.3\n      0.3\n      0.3\n    \n    \n      120\n      5\n      64\n      218.893889\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      0.3\n    \n    \n      135\n      5\n      86\n      213.491667\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      0.3\n      1.7\n      0.3\n      1.7\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBootstrap\nFor the bootstrap replicates, we need to provide the number of replicates.

    "text": "Nonresponse adjustment\nIn general, the sample weights are adjusted to redistribute the sample weights of all eligible units for which there is no sufficient response (unit level nonresponse) to the sampling units that sufficiently responded to the survey. This adjustment is done within adjustment classes or domains. Note that the determination of the response categories (unit response, item response, ineligible, etc.) is outside of the scope of this tutorial.\nAlso, the weights of the sampling units with unknown eligibility are redistributed to the rest of the sampling units. In general, ineligible sampling units receive weights from the sampling units with unknown eligibility since eligible sampling units can be part of the unknown pool.\nThe method adjust() has a boolean parameter unknown_to_inelig which controls how the sample weights of the unknown is redistributed. By default, adjust() redistribute the sample weights of the sampling units of the unknown to the ineligibles (unknown_to_inelig=True). If we do not wish to redistribute the sample weights of the unknowns to the ineligibles then we just set the flag to False (unknown_to_inelig=Fasle).\nIn the snippet of code below, we adjust the weight within clusters that is we use clusters as our adjustment classes. Note that we run the nonresponse adjustment twice, the first time with unknown_to_inelig=True (nr_weight) and the second time with the flag equal to False (nr_weight2). With unknown_to_inelig=True, the ineligible received part of the sample weights from the unknowns. Hence, the sample weights for the respondent is less than when the flag is False. With unknown_to_inelig=Fasle, the ineligible did Not receive any weights from the unknowns. Hence, the sample weights for the ineligible units remain the same before and after adjustment. In a real survey, the statistician may decide on the best non-response strategy based on the available information.\n\nstatus_mapping = {\n    \"in\": \"ineligible\", \n    \"rr\": \"respondent\", \n    \"nr\": \"non-respondent\", \n    \"uk\": \"unknown\"\n    }\n\nfull_sample[\"nr_weight\"] = SampleWeight().adjust(\n    samp_weight=full_sample[\"design_weight\"],\n    adj_class=full_sample[[\"region\", \"cluster\"]],\n    resp_status=full_sample[\"response_status\"],\n    resp_dict=status_mapping,\n)\n\nfull_sample[\"nr_weight2\"] = SampleWeight().adjust(\n    samp_weight=full_sample[\"design_weight\"],\n    adj_class=full_sample[[\"region\", \"cluster\"]],\n    resp_status=full_sample[\"response_status\"],\n    resp_dict=status_mapping,\n    unknown_to_inelig=False,\n)\n\nfull_sample[[\n    \"cluster\", \n    \"region\", \n    \"design_weight\", \n    \"response_status\", \n    \"nr_weight\", \n    \"nr_weight2\"\n    ]].drop_duplicates().head(15)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      cluster\n      region\n      design_weight\n      response_status\n      nr_weight\n      nr_weight2\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      7\n      North\n      46.166667\n      ineligible\n      49.464286\n      46.166667\n    \n    \n      1\n      7\n      North\n      46.166667\n      respondent\n      54.410714\n      55.400000\n    \n    \n      4\n      7\n      North\n      46.166667\n      unknown\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      11\n      7\n      North\n      46.166667\n      non-respondent\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      15\n      10\n      North\n      50.783333\n      non-respondent\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      16\n      10\n      North\n      50.783333\n      respondent\n      70.733929\n      71.096667\n    \n    \n      19\n      10\n      North\n      50.783333\n      ineligible\n      54.410714\n      50.783333\n    \n    \n      21\n      10\n      North\n      50.783333\n      unknown\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      30\n      16\n      South\n      62.149123\n      respondent\n      66.588346\n      66.588346\n    \n    \n      35\n      16\n      South\n      62.149123\n      non-respondent\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      45\n      24\n      South\n      58.940741\n      respondent\n      63.852469\n      63.852469\n    \n    \n      47\n      24\n      South\n      58.940741\n      non-respondent\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      55\n      24\n      South\n      58.940741\n      ineligible\n      58.940741\n      58.940741\n    \n    \n      60\n      29\n      South\n      65.702778\n      unknown\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      61\n      29\n      South\n      65.702778\n      respondent\n      101.081197\n      102.204321\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe default call of adjust() expects standard codes for response status that is “in”, “rr”, “nr”, and “uk” where “in” means ineligible, “rr” means respondent, “nr” means non-respondent, and “uk” means unknown eligibility.\n\n\nIn the call above, if we omit the parameter response_dict, then the run would fail with an assertion error message. The current error message is the following: The response status must only contains values in (‘in’, ‘rr’, ‘nr’, ‘uk’) or the mapping should be provided using response_dict parameter. For the call to run without using response_dict, it is necessary that the response status takes only values in the standard codes i.e. (“in”, “rr”, “nr”, “uk”). The variable associated with response_status can contain any code but a mapping is necessary when the response variable is not constructed using the standard codes.\nTo further illustrate the mapping of response status, let’s assume that we have response_status2 which has the values 100 for ineligible, 200 for non-respondent, 300 for respondent, and 999 for unknown.\n\nresponse_status2 = np.repeat(100, full_sample[\"response_status\"].shape[0])\nresponse_status2[full_sample[\"response_status\"] == \"non-respondent\"] = 200\nresponse_status2[full_sample[\"response_status\"] == \"respondent\"] = 300\nresponse_status2[full_sample[\"response_status\"] == \"unknown\"] = 999\n\npd.crosstab(response_status2, full_sample[\"response_status\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      response_status\n      ineligible\n      non-respondent\n      respondent\n      unknown\n    \n    \n      row_0\n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      100\n      16\n      0\n      0\n      0\n    \n    \n      200\n      0\n      23\n      0\n      0\n    \n    \n      300\n      0\n      0\n      106\n      0\n    \n    \n      999\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      5\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nTo use response_status2, we need to map the values 100, 200, 300 and 999 to “in”, “rr”, “nr”, and “uk”. This mapping is done below using the Python dictionary status_mapping2. Using status_mapping2 in the function call adjust() will lead to the same adjustment as in the previous run i.e. nr_weight and nr_weight3 contain the same adjusted weights.\n\nstatus_mapping2 = {\"in\": 100, \"nr\": 200, \"rr\": 300, \"uk\": 999}\n\nfull_sample[\"nr_weight3\"] = SampleWeight().adjust(\n    samp_weight=full_sample[\"design_weight\"],\n    adj_class=full_sample[[\"region\", \"cluster\"]],\n    resp_status=response_status2,\n    resp_dict=status_mapping2,\n)\n\nfull_sample[\n    [\"cluster\", \"region\", \"response_status\", \"nr_weight\", \"nr_weight3\"]\n    ].drop_duplicates().head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      cluster\n      region\n      response_status\n      nr_weight\n      nr_weight3\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      7\n      North\n      ineligible\n      49.464286\n      49.464286\n    \n    \n      1\n      7\n      North\n      respondent\n      54.410714\n      54.410714\n    \n    \n      4\n      7\n      North\n      unknown\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      11\n      7\n      North\n      non-respondent\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      15\n      10\n      North\n      non-respondent\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nIf the response status variable only takes values “in”, “nr”, “rr” and “uk”, then it is not necessary to provide the mapping dictionary to the function i.e. resp_dict can be omitted from the function call adjust().\n\nresponse_status3 = np.repeat(\"in\", full_sample[\"response_status\"].shape[0])\nresponse_status3[full_sample[\"response_status\"] == \"non-respondent\"] = \"nr\"\nresponse_status3[full_sample[\"response_status\"] == \"respondent\"] = \"rr\"\nresponse_status3[full_sample[\"response_status\"] == \"unknown\"] = \"uk\"\n\nfull_sample[\"nr_weight4\"] = SampleWeight().adjust(\n    samp_weight=full_sample[\"design_weight\"],\n    adj_class=full_sample[[\"region\", \"cluster\"]],\n    resp_status=response_status3,\n)\n\nfull_sample[\n    [\"cluster\", \"region\", \"response_status\", \"nr_weight\", \"nr_weight4\"]\n    ].drop_duplicates().head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      cluster\n      region\n      response_status\n      nr_weight\n      nr_weight4\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      7\n      North\n      ineligible\n      49.464286\n      49.464286\n    \n    \n      1\n      7\n      North\n      respondent\n      54.410714\n      54.410714\n    \n    \n      4\n      7\n      North\n      unknown\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      11\n      7\n      North\n      non-respondent\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      15\n      10\n      North\n      non-respondent\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n# Just dropping a couple of variables \n# not needed for the rest of the tutorial\nfull_sample.drop(\n    columns=[\n        \"psu_prob\", \n        \"ssu_prob\", \n        \"inclusion_prob\", \n        \"nr_weight2\", \n        \"nr_weight3\", \n        \"nr_weight4\"\n        ], \n    inplace=True\n)"

The most common poststratification method consists of adjusting the sample weights to ensure that they sum to known control values from reliable souces by adjustment classes (domains). Poststratification classes can be formed using variables beyond the ones involved in the sampling design. For example, socio-economic variables such as age group, gender, race and education are often used to form poststratification classes/cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\npoststratifying to totals that are known to be out of date, and thus likely inaccurate and/or unreliable may not improve the estimate. Use this with caution.\n\n\nLet’s assume that we have a reliable external source e.g. a recent census that provides the number of households by region. The external source has the following control data: 3700 households for East, 1500 for North, 2800 for South and 6500 for West.\nWe use the method poststratify() to ensure that the poststratified sample weights (ps_weight) sum to the know control totals by region.

For example, WHO EPI vaccination surveys often postratify sample weights to ensure that relative sizes of strata reflect offcial statistics e.g. census data. In most cases, the strata are based on some administrative divisions.\nFor example, assume that according to census data that East contains 25% of the households, North contains 10%, South contains 20% and West contains 45%. We can poststratify using the snippet of code below.\n\nknown_ratios = {\"East\": 0.25, \"North\": 0.10, \"South\": 0.20, \"West\": 0.45}\nfull_sample[\"ps_weight2\"] = SampleWeight().poststratify(\n    samp_weight=full_sample[\"nr_weight\"], \n    factor=known_ratios, \n    domain=full_sample[\"region\"]\n)\n\nfull_sample.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      cluster\n      region\n      household\n      design_weight\n      response_status\n      nr_weight\n      ps_weight\n      ps_adj_fct\n      ps_weight2\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      7\n      North\n      72\n      46.166667\n      ineligible\n      49.464286\n      51.020408\n      1.03146\n      49.117777\n    \n    \n      1\n      7\n      North\n      73\n      46.166667\n      respondent\n      54.410714\n      56.122449\n      1.03146\n      54.029554\n    \n    \n      2\n      7\n      North\n      75\n      46.166667\n      respondent\n      54.410714\n      56.122449\n      1.03146\n      54.029554\n    \n    \n      3\n      7\n      North\n      715\n      46.166667\n      respondent\n      54.410714\n      56.122449\n      1.03146\n      54.029554\n    \n    \n      4\n      7\n      North\n      722\n      46.166667\n      unknown\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      NaN\n      0.000000\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nsum_of_weights2 = full_sample[\n    [\"region\", \"nr_weight\", \"ps_weight2\"]\n    ].groupby(\"region\").sum()\nsum_of_weights2.reset_index(inplace=True)\nsum_of_weights2[\"ratio\"] = \\\n    sum_of_weights2[\"ps_weight2\"] / sum(sum_of_weights2[\"ps_weight2\"])\nsum_of_weights2.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      region\n      nr_weight\n      ps_weight2\n      ratio\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      East\n      3698.703391\n      3610.156586\n      0.25\n    \n    \n      1\n      North\n      1454.250000\n      1444.062634\n      0.10\n    \n    \n      2\n      South\n      2801.889620\n      2888.125269\n      0.20\n    \n    \n      3\n      West\n      6485.783333\n      6498.281855\n      0.45\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nCalibration\nCalibration is a more general concept for adjusting sample weights to sum to known constants. In this tutorial, we consider the generalized regression (GREG) class of calibration. Assume that we have \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\sum_{i \\in s} w_i y_i\\) and know population totals \\(\\mathbf{X} = (\\mathbf{X}_1, ..., \\mathbf{X}_p)^T\\) are available. Working under the model \\(Y_i | \\mathbf{x}_i = \\mathbf{x}^T_i \\mathbf{\\beta} + \\epsilon_i\\), the GREG estimator of the population total is\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_{GR} = \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} + (\\mathbf{X} - \\hat{\\mathbf{X}})^T\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}\\) is the weighted least squares estimate of \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{X}}\\) is the survey estimate of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). The essential of the GREG approach is, under the regression model, to find the adjusted weights \\(w^{*}_i\\) that are the closest to \\(w_i\\), to minimize \\(h(z) = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in s} c_i(w_i - z_i)}{w_i}\\).\nLet us simulate three auxiliary variables that is education, poverty and under_five (number of children under five in the household) and assume that we have the following control totals.\n\nTotal number of under five children: 6300 in the East, 4000 in the North, 6500 in the South and 14000 in the West.\nPoverty (Yes: in poverty / No: not in poverty)\n\n\n\nRegion  \nPoverty  \nNumber of households\n\n\n\n\nEast\nNo\n2600\n\n\n\nYes\n1200\n\n\nNorth\nNo\n1500\n\n\n\nYes\n200\n\n\nSouth\nNo\n1800\n\n\n\nYes\n1100\n\n\nWest\nNo\n4500\n\n\n\nYes\n2200\n\n\n\nEducation (Low: less than secondary, Medium: secondary completed, and High: More than secondary)\n\n\n\nRegion  \nEducation  \nNumber of households\n\n\n\n\nEast\nLow\n2000\n\n\n\nMedium\n1400\n\n\n\nHigh\n350\n\n\nNorth\nLow\n550\n\n\n\nMedium\n700\n\n\n\nHigh\n250\n\n\nSouth\nLow\n1300\n\n\n\nMedium\n1200\n\n\n\nHigh\n350\n\n\nWest\nLow\n2100\n\n\n\nMedium\n4000\n\n\n\nHigh\n500\n\n\n\n\n\nnp.random.seed(150)\nfull_sample[\"education\"] = np.random.choice(\n    (\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"), \n    size=150, \n    p=(0.40, 0.50, 0.10)\n    )\nfull_sample[\"poverty\"] = np.random.choice((0, 1), size=150, p=(0.70, 0.30))\nfull_sample[\"under_five\"] = np.random.choice(\n    (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), \n    size=150, \n    p=(0.05, 0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05)\n    )\n\nfull_sample[[\n    \"cluster\", \n    \"region\", \n    \"household\", \n    \"nr_weight\", \n    \"education\", \n    \"poverty\", \n    \"under_five\"\n    ]].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      cluster\n      region\n      household\n      nr_weight\n      education\n      poverty\n      under_five\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      7\n      North\n      72\n      49.464286\n      High\n      1\n      1\n    \n    \n      1\n      7\n      North\n      73\n      54.410714\n      Low\n      0\n      3\n    \n    \n      2\n      7\n      North\n      75\n      54.410714\n      Medium\n      0\n      2\n    \n    \n      3\n      7\n      North\n      715\n      54.410714\n      Medium\n      1\n      2\n    \n    \n      4\n      7\n      North\n      722\n      0.000000\n      Medium\n      0\n      2\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe now will calibrate the nonreponse weight (nr_weight) to ensure that the estimated number of households in poverty is equal to 4,700 and the estimated total number of children under five is 30,8500. The control numbers 4,700 and 30,800 are obtained from the table above.\nThe class SampleWeight() uses the method calibrate(samp_weight, aux_vars, control, domain, scale, bounded, modified) to adjust the weight using the GREG approach. * The contol values must be stored in a python dictionnary i.e. totals = {“poverty”: 4700, “under_five”: 30800}. In this case, we have two numerical variables poverty with values in {0, 1} and under_five with values in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. * aux_vars is the matrix of covariates.\n\ntotals = {\"poverty\": 4700, \"under_five\": 30800}\n\nfull_sample[\"calib_weight\"] = SampleWeight().calibrate(\n    full_sample[\"nr_weight\"], full_sample[[\"poverty\", \"under_five\"]], totals\n)\n\nfull_sample[[\"cluster\", \"region\", \"household\", \"nr_weight\", \"calib_weight\"]].head(15)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      cluster\n      region\n      household\n      nr_weight\n      calib_weight\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      7\n      North\n      72\n      49.464286\n      50.432441\n    \n    \n      1\n      7\n      North\n      73\n      54.410714\n      57.233887\n    \n    \n      2\n      7\n      North\n      75\n      54.410714\n      56.292829\n    \n    \n      3\n      7\n      North\n      715\n      54.410714\n      56.416743\n    \n    \n      4\n      7\n      North\n      722\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      5\n      7\n      North\n      724\n      54.410714\n      57.233887\n    \n    \n      6\n      7\n      North\n      755\n      54.410714\n      57.233887\n    \n    \n      7\n      7\n      North\n      761\n      49.464286\n      49.464286\n    \n    \n      8\n      7\n      North\n      764\n      54.410714\n      56.292829\n    \n    \n      9\n      7\n      North\n      782\n      54.410714\n      57.233887\n    \n    \n      10\n      7\n      North\n      795\n      54.410714\n      58.174944\n    \n    \n      11\n      7\n      North\n      7111\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      12\n      7\n      North\n      7112\n      54.410714\n      59.116002\n    \n    \n      13\n      7\n      North\n      7117\n      49.464286\n      50.319793\n    \n    \n      14\n      7\n      North\n      7123\n      54.410714\n      56.292829\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can confirm that the estimated totals for the auxiliary variables are equal to their control values.\n\npoverty = full_sample[\"poverty\"]\nunder_5 = full_sample[\"under_five\"]\nnr_weight = full_sample[\"nr_weight\"]\ncalib_weight = full_sample[\"calib_weight\"]\n\nprint(\n    f\"\"\"\\nTotal estimated number of poor households was \n    {sum(poverty*nr_weight):.2f} before adjustment and \n    {sum(poverty*calib_weight):.2f} after adjustment.\\n\"\"\"\n)\nprint(\n    f\"\"\"Total estimated number of children under 5 was \n    {sum(under_5*nr_weight):.2f} before adjustment and \n    {sum(under_5*calib_weight):.2f} after adjustment.\\n\"\"\"\n)\n\n\nTotal estimated number of poor households was \n    4521.84 before adjustment and \n    4700.00 after adjustment.\n\nTotal estimated number of children under 5 was \n    29442.52 before adjustment and \n    30800.00 after adjustment.\n\n\n\nIf we want to control by domain then we can do so using the parameter domain of calibrate(). First we need to update the python dictionary holding the control values. Now, those values have to be provided for each domain. Note that the dictionary is now a nested dictionary where the higher level keys hold the domain values i.e. East, North, South and West. Then the higher level values of the dictionary are the dictionaries providing mapping for the auxiliary variables and the corresponding control values.\n\ntotals_by_domain = {\n    \"East\": {\"poverty\": 1200, \"under_five\": 6300},\n    \"North\": {\"poverty\": 200, \"under_five\": 4000},\n    \"South\": {\"poverty\": 1100, \"under_five\": 6500},\n    \"West\": {\"poverty\": 2200, \"under_five\": 14000},\n}\n\nfull_sample[\"calib_weight_d\"] = SampleWeight().calibrate(\n    full_sample[\"nr_weight\"], \n    full_sample[[\"poverty\", \"under_five\"]], \n    totals_by_domain, full_sample[\"region\"]\n)\n\nfull_sample[[\n    \"cluster\", \n    \"region\", \n    \"household\", \n    \"nr_weight\", \n    \"calib_weight\", \n    \"calib_weight_d\"\n    ]].head(15)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      cluster\n      region\n      household\n      nr_weight\n      calib_weight\n      calib_weight_d\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      7\n      North\n      72\n      49.464286\n      50.432441\n      40.892864\n    \n    \n      1\n      7\n      North\n      73\n      54.410714\n      57.233887\n      61.852139\n    \n    \n      2\n      7\n      North\n      75\n      54.410714\n      56.292829\n      59.371664\n    \n    \n      3\n      7\n      North\n      715\n      54.410714\n      56.416743\n      47.462625\n    \n    \n      4\n      7\n      North\n      722\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      5\n      7\n      North\n      724\n      54.410714\n      57.233887\n      61.852139\n    \n    \n      6\n      7\n      North\n      755\n      54.410714\n      57.233887\n      61.852139\n    \n    \n      7\n      7\n      North\n      761\n      49.464286\n      49.464286\n      49.464286\n    \n    \n      8\n      7\n      North\n      764\n      54.410714\n      56.292829\n      59.371664\n    \n    \n      9\n      7\n      North\n      782\n      54.410714\n      57.233887\n      61.852139\n    \n    \n      10\n      7\n      North\n      795\n      54.410714\n      58.174944\n      64.332614\n    \n    \n      11\n      7\n      North\n      7111\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n      0.000000\n    \n    \n      12\n      7\n      North\n      7112\n      54.410714\n      59.116002\n      66.813089\n    \n    \n      13\n      7\n      North\n      7117\n      49.464286\n      50.319793\n      51.719263\n    \n    \n      14\n      7\n      North\n      7123\n      54.410714\n      56.292829\n      59.371664\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nNote that the GREG domain estimates above do not have the additive property.

    "text": "In the cells below, we illustrate a simple example of sample size calculation in the context of household surveys using stage sampling designs. Let’s assume that we want to calculate sample size for a vaccination survey in Senegal. We want to stratify the sample by administrative region. We will use the 2017 Senegal Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) to get an idea of the vaccination coverage rates for some main vaccine-doses. Below, we show coverage rates of hepatitis B birth dose (hepB0) vaccine, first and third dose of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP), first dose of measles containing vaccine (MCV1) and coverage of basic vaccination. Basic vaccination refers to the 12-23 months old children that received BCG vaccine, three doses of DTP containing vaccine, three doses of polio vaccine, and the first dose of measles containing vaccine.The table below shows the 2017 Senegal DHS vaccination coverage of a few vaccine-doses for children aged 12 to 23 months old.\nThe 2017 Senegal DHS data collection happened from April to December 2018. Therefore, the data shown in the table represent children born from October 2016 to December 2017. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will assume that these vaccine coverage rates still hold. Furthermore, we will use the basic vaccination coverage rates to calculate sample size."

    "text": "Wald method\nThe first step is to create and object using the SampleSize class with the parameter of interest, the sample size calculation method, and the stratification status. In this example, we want to calculate sample size for proportions, using wald method for a stratified design. This is achived with the following snippet of code.\n\nSampleSize(\n    param=\"proportion\", method=\"wald\", strat=True\n)\n\nBecause, we are using a stratified sample design, it is best to specify the expected coverage levels by stratum. If the information is not available then aggregated values can be used across the strata. The 2017 Senegal DHS published the coverage rates by region hence we have the information available by stratum. To provide the informmation to Samplics we use the python dictionaries as follows\n\nexpected_coverage = {\n    \"Dakar\": 0.849,\n    \"Ziguinchor\": 0.809,\n    \"Diourbel\": 0.682,\n    \"Saint-Louis\": 0.806,\n    \"Tambacounda\": 0.470,\n    \"Kaolack\": 0.797,\n    \"Thies\": 0.834,\n    \"Louga\": 0.678,\n    \"Fatick\": 0.766,\n    \"Kolda\": 0.637,\n    \"Matam\": 0.687,\n    \"Kaffrine\": 0.766,\n    \"Kedougou\": 0.336,\n    \"Sedhiou\": 0.742,\n}\n\nNow, we want to calculate the sample size with desired precision of 0.07 which means that we want the expected vaccination coverage rates to have 7% half confidence intervals e.g. expected rate of 90% will have a confidence interval of [83%, 97%]. Note that the desired precision can be specified by stratum in a similar way as the target coverage using a python dictionary.\nGiven that information, we can calculate the sample size using SampleSize class as follows.\n\nfrom samplics.utils.types import SizeMethod, PopParam\n\n# Declare the sample size calculation parameters\nsen_vaccine_wald = SampleSize(\n    param=PopParam.prop, method=SizeMethod.wald, strat=True\n)\n\n# calculate the sample size\nsen_vaccine_wald.calculate(target=expected_coverage, half_ci=0.07)\n\n# show the calculated sample size\nprint(f\"\\nCalculated sample sizes by stratum: \")\nsen_vaccine_wald.samp_size\n\n\nCalculated sample sizes by stratum: \n\n\n{'Dakar': 101,\n 'Ziguinchor': 122,\n 'Diourbel': 171,\n 'Saint-Louis': 123,\n 'Tambacounda': 196,\n 'Kaolack': 127,\n 'Thies': 109,\n 'Louga': 172,\n 'Fatick': 141,\n 'Kolda': 182,\n 'Matam': 169,\n 'Kaffrine': 141,\n 'Kedougou': 175,\n 'Sedhiou': 151}\n\n\nSampleSize calculates the sample sizes and store the in teh samp_size attributes which is a python dictinary object.

A design effect of 1 correspond to sampling design with a variance equivalent to a simple random selection of same sample size. In the context of complex sampling designs, DEFF is often different from 1. Stage sampling and unequal weights usually increase the design effect above 1. The 2017 Senegal DHS indicated a design effect equal to 1.963 (1.401^2) for basic vaccination.

The current list of datasets is the following:\n\nBirth: This dataset represent a city data of categories of birth by age group. The dataset was obtained through the public stata API. Use load_birth() to load the dataset.\nCountyCrop and CountryCropMeans: These datasets were used by Battese, Harter, and Fuller (1988) for their pioner paper on small area estimation. Use load_county_crop() and load_county_crop_means() to load the datasets.\nExpenditureMilk: The Milk Expenditure data contains 43 observations on the average expenditure on fresh milk for the year 1989. This dataset was originally used by Arora and Lahiri (1997) and later by You and Chapman (2006). Use load_expenditure_milk() to load the dataset.\nNhanes2, Nhanes2brr, and Nhanes2jk: these datasets were obtained from the NHANES (McDowell et al. 1981)_. As mentioned above, the datasets are only subsets of the full sample and do not represent the NHANES II study. This data is only useful for illustrating the syntax of samplics. These datasets should not be used to conduct any analysis of NHANES nor use the numbers for any statistical analysis. The original data was obtained through the public stata API. Use load_nhanes2(), load_nhanes2brr(), and load_nhanes2jk() to load the datasets.\nNmihs: The dataset is a subset of the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS) sample (Gonzalez Jr, N, and C 1992). The dataset should not be used to conduct any analysis of NMIHS nor use the numbers for any statistical analysis. The original data was obtained through the public stata API. Use load_nmihs() to load the dataset.\nPSUFrame, PSUSample, and SSUSample: these are simulated datasets to illustrate the selectionof primary and secondary sampling units. Use load_psu_frame(), load_psu_sample(), and load_ssu_sample() to load the datasets.\n\nLet’s assume we want to load the PSU frame, we could write the following code.\n\nimport samplics\n\n# Import the appropriate class.\nfrom samplics.datasets import load_psu_frame\n\n# Load the dataset and its metadata into \n# the variable (dictionary) psu_frame_dict\npsu_frame_dict = load_psu_frame()\n\n# Store the datasets in the variable psu_frame (optional)\npsu_frame = psu_frame_dict[\"data\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe datasets should not be used for any statistical analysis.  No number shown in this tutorial shall be used for any statistical analysis.  All the examples are exclusively for illustrating the syntax and APIs of Samplics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBattese, G E, R M Harter, and W A Fuller. 1988. “An Error-Components Model for Prediction of County Crop Areas Using Survey and Satellite Data.” J.

weights. The stratum variable is not indicated in the dataset or survey design description. However, it says that the number of strata is 31 and the number of replicates is 62. Hence, the jackknife replicate coefficient is \\((n_h - 1) / n_h = (2-1) / 2 = 0.5\\). Now we can call replicate() and specify rep_coefs = 0.5.\n\njackknife = ReplicateEstimator(\"jackknife\", \"ratio\")\n\nratio_wgt_hgt2 = jackknife.estimate(\n    y=nhanes2jk[\"weight\"],\n    samp_weight=nhanes2jk[\"finalwgt\"],\n    x=nhanes2jk[\"height\"],\n    rep_weights=nhanes2jk.loc[:, \"jkw_1\":\"jkw_62\"],\n    rep_coefs=0.5,\n    remove_nan=True,\n)\n\nprint(ratio_wgt_hgt2)\n\nSAMPLICS - Estimation of Ratio\n\nNumber of strata: None\nNumber of psus: None\nDegree of freedom: 61\n\n   RATIO       SE      LCI      UCI      CV\n0.423502 0.003464 0.416574 0.430429 0.00818"

The class Sample has two main methods that is inclusion_probs and select. The method inclusion_probs() computes the probability of selection and select() draws the random samples.\nThe following will illustrate the use of samplics for sample selection. For the illustration,\nThis example is not meant to be exhaustif. There are many use cases that are not covered in this tutorial. For example, some PSUs may be segmented due to their size and segments selected in a subsequent step. Segment selection can be done with Samplics in a similar way as the PSUs selection, with PPS or SRS, after the segements have been created by the user.\nFirst, let us import the python packages necessary to run the tutorial."

For example, most countries do not have a list of all households or people living in the country. Even if such frames exist, it may not be operationally and financially feasible to directly select sampling units without any form of clustering.\nHence, stage sampling is a common strategy used by large household national surveys for selecting samples of households and people. At the first stage, geographic or administrative clusters of households are selected. At the second stage, a frame of households is created from the selected clusters and a sample of households is selected. At the third stage (if applicable), a sample of people is selected from the households in the sample. This is a high level description of the process; usually implementations are much less straightforward and may require many adjustments to address complexities."

    "text": "PSU Probability of Selection\nAt the first stage, we use the proportional to size (pps) method to select a random sample of clusters. The measure of size is the number of households (number_households) as provided in the psu sampling frame. The sample is stratified by region. The probabilities, for stratified pps, is obtained as follow: \\[\\begin{equation} p_{hi} = \\frac{n_h M_{hi}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}{M_{hi}}} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(p_{hi}\\) is the probability of selection for unit \\(i\\) from stratum \\(h\\), \\(M_{hi}\\) is the measure of size (mos), \\(n_h\\) and \\(N_h\\) are the sample size and the total number of clusters in stratum \\(h\\), respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe PPS method is used in many surveys not just for multistage household surveys.\nFor example, in business surveys, establishments can greatly vary in size; hence pps methods are often use to select samples.

    "text": "PSU Sample size\nFor a stratified sampling design, the sample size is provided using a Python dictionary. Python dictionaries allow us to pair the strata with the sample sizes. Let’s say that we want to select 3 clusters from stratum East, 2 from West, 2 from North and 3 from South. The snippet of code below demonstrates how to create the Python dictionary. Note that it is important to correctly spell out the keys of the dictionary which corresponds to the values of the variable stratum (in our case it’s region).\n\npsu_sample_size = {\"East\":3, \"West\": 2, \"North\": 2, \"South\": 3}\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe sample size per domain is:\\n {psu_sample_size}\\n\")\n\n\nThe sample size per domain is:\n {'East': 3, 'West': 2, 'North': 2, 'South': 3}\n\n\n\nThe function array_to_dict() converts an array to a dictionnary by pairing the values of the array to their frequency. We can use this function to calculates the number of clusters per stratum and store the result in a Python dictionnary. Then, we modify the values of the dictionnary to create the sample size dictionnary.\nIf some of the clusters are certainties then an exception will be raised. Hence, the user will have to manually handle the certaininties.
