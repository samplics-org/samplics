    "text": "In the sections below, we draw primary sampling units (PSUs) using probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling techniques implemented in the Sample class. The class Sample has two main methods that is inclusion_probs and select. The method inclusion_probs() computes the probability of selection and select() draws the random samples.\nThe following will illustrate the use of samplics for sample selection. For the illustration,\nThis example is not meant to be exhaustif. There are many use cases that are not covered in this tutorial. For example, some PSUs may be segmented due to their size and segments selected in a subsequent step. Segment selection can be done with Samplics in a similar way as the PSUs selection, with PPS or SRS, after the segements have been created by the user.\nFirst, let us import the python packages necessary to run the tutorial.\nimport numpy as np \nfrom samplics.datasets import load_psu_frame\n\nfrom samplics import SelectMethod\nfrom samplics.sampling import SampleSelection",

For example, most countries do not have a list of all households or people living in the country. Even if such frames exist, it may not be operationally and financially feasible to directly select sampling units without any form of clustering.\nHence, stage sampling is a common strategy used by large household national surveys for selecting samples of households and people. At the first stage, geographic or administrative clusters of households are selected. At the second stage, a frame of households is created from the selected clusters and a sample of households is selected. At the third stage (if applicable), a sample of people is selected from the households in the sample. This is a high level description of the process; usually implementations are much less straightforward and may require many adjustments to address complexities.",

    "text": "PSU Probability of Selection\nAt the first stage, we use the proportional to size (pps) method to select a random sample of clusters. The measure of size is the number of households (number_households) as provided in the psu sampling frame. The sample is stratified by region. The probabilities, for stratified pps, is obtained as follow: \\[\\begin{equation} p_{hi} = \\frac{n_h M_{hi}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}{M_{hi}}} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(p_{hi}\\) is the probability of selection for unit \\(i\\) from stratum \\(h\\), \\(M_{hi}\\) is the measure of size (mos), \\(n_h\\) and \\(N_h\\) are the sample size and the total number of clusters in stratum \\(h\\), respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe PPS method is used in many surveys not just for multistage household surveys.\nFor example, in business surveys, establishments can greatly vary in size; hence pps methods are often use to select samples.

Let’s say that we want to select 3 clusters from stratum East, 2 from West, 2 from North and 3 from South. The snippet of code below demonstrates how to create the Python dictionary. Note that it is important to correctly spell out the keys of the dictionary which corresponds to the values of the variable stratum (in our case it’s region).\n\npsu_sample_size = {\"East\":3, \"West\": 2, \"North\": 2, \"South\": 3}\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe sample size per domain is:\\n {psu_sample_size}\\n\")\n\n\nThe sample size per domain is:\n {'East': 3, 'West': 2, 'North': 2, 'South': 3}\n\n\n\nThe function array_to_dict() converts an array to a dictionnary by pairing the values of the array to their frequency.

The current list of datasets is the following:\n\nBirth: This dataset represent a city data of categories of birth by age group. The dataset was obtained through the public stata API. Use load_birth() to load the dataset.\nCountyCrop and CountryCropMeans: These datasets were used by Battese, Harter, and Fuller (1988) for their pioner paper on small area estimation. Use load_county_crop() and load_county_crop_means() to load the datasets.\nExpenditureMilk: The Milk Expenditure data contains 43 observations on the average expenditure on fresh milk for the year 1989. This dataset was originally used by Arora and Lahiri (1997) and later by You and Chapman (2006). Use load_expenditure_milk() to load the dataset.\nNhanes2, Nhanes2brr, and Nhanes2jk: these datasets were obtained from the NHANES (McDowell et al. 1981)_. As mentioned above, the datasets are only subsets of the full sample and do not represent the NHANES II study. This data is only useful for illustrating the syntax of samplics. These datasets should not be used to conduct any analysis of NHANES nor use the numbers for any statistical analysis. The original data was obtained through the public stata API.

    "text": "Nonresponse adjustment\nIn general, the sample weights are adjusted to redistribute the sample weights of all eligible units for which there is no sufficient response (unit level nonresponse) to the sampling units that sufficiently responded to the survey. This adjustment is done within adjustment classes or domains. Note that the determination of the response categories (unit response, item response, ineligible, etc.) is outside of the scope of this tutorial.\nAlso, the weights of the sampling units with unknown eligibility are redistributed to the rest of the sampling units. In general, ineligible sampling units receive weights from the sampling units with unknown eligibility since eligible sampling units can be part of the unknown pool.\nThe method adjust() has a boolean parameter unknown_to_inelig which controls how the sample weights of the unknown is redistributed. By default, adjust() redistribute the sample weights of the sampling units of the unknown to the ineligibles (unknown_to_inelig=True). If we do not wish to redistribute the sample weights of the unknowns to the ineligibles then we just set the flag to False (unknown_to_inelig=Fasle).\nIn the snippet of code below, we adjust the weight within clusters that is we use clusters as our adjustment classes. Note that we run the nonresponse adjustment twice, the first time with unknown_to_inelig=True (nr_weight) and the second time with the flag equal to False (nr_weight2). With unknown_to_inelig=True, the ineligible received part of the sample weights from the unknowns. Hence, the sample weights for the respondent is less than when the flag is False. With unknown_to_inelig=Fasle, the ineligible did Not receive any weights from the unknowns. Hence, the sample weights for the ineligible units remain the same before and after adjustment. In a real survey, the statistician may decide on the best non-response strategy based on the available information.\n\nstatus_mapping = {\n    \"in\": \"ineligible\", \n    \"rr\": \"respondent\", \n    \"nr\": \"non-respondent\", \n    \"uk\": \"unknown\"\n    }\n\nfull_sample[\"nr_weight\"] = SampleWeight().adjust(\n    samp_weight=full_sample[\"design_weight\"],\n    adj_class=full_sample[[\"region\", \"cluster\"]],\n    resp_status=full_sample[\"response_status\"],\n    resp_dict=status_mapping,\n)\n\nfull_sample[\"nr_weight2\"] = SampleWeight().adjust(\n    samp_weight=full_sample[\"design_weight\"],\n    adj_class=full_sample[[\"region\", \"cluster\"]],\n    resp_status=full_sample[\"response_status\"],\n    resp_dict=status_mapping,\n    unknown_to_inelig=False,\n)\n\nfull_sample[[\n    \"cluster\", \n    \"region\", \n    \"design_weight\", \n    \"response_status\", \n    \"nr_weight\", \n    \"nr_weight2\"\n    ]].drop_duplicates().head(15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncluster\nregion\ndesign_weight\nresponse_status\nnr_weight\nnr_weight2\n\n\n\n\n0\n7\nNorth\n46.166667\nineligible\n49.464286\n46.166667\n\n\n1\n7\nNorth\n46.166667\nrespondent\n54.410714\n55.400000\n\n\n4\n7\nNorth\n46.166667\nunknown\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n11\n7\nNorth\n46.166667\nnon-respondent\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n15\n10\nNorth\n50.783333\nnon-respondent\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n16\n10\nNorth\n50.783333\nrespondent\n70.733929\n71.096667\n\n\n19\n10\nNorth\n50.783333\nineligible\n54.410714\n50.783333\n\n\n21\n10\nNorth\n50.783333\nunknown\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n30\n16\nSouth\n62.149123\nrespondent\n66.588346\n66.588346\n\n\n35\n16\nSouth\n62.149123\nnon-respondent\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n45\n24\nSouth\n58.940741\nrespondent\n63.852469\n63.852469\n\n\n47\n24\nSouth\n58.940741\nnon-respondent\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n55\n24\nSouth\n58.940741\nineligible\n58.940741\n58.940741\n\n\n60\n29\nSouth\n65.702778\nunknown\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n61\n29\nSouth\n65.702778\nrespondent\n101.081197\n102.204321\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe default call of adjust() expects standard codes for response status that is “in”, “rr”, “nr”, and “uk” where “in” means ineligible, “rr” means respondent, “nr” means non-respondent, and “uk” means unknown eligibility.\n\n\nIn the call above, if we omit the parameter response_dict, then the run would fail with an assertion error message. The current error message is the following: The response status must only contains values in (‘in’, ‘rr’, ‘nr’, ‘uk’) or the mapping should be provided using response_dict parameter. For the call to run without using response_dict, it is necessary that the response status takes only values in the standard codes i.e. (“in”, “rr”, “nr”, “uk”). The variable associated with response_status can contain any code but a mapping is necessary when the response variable is not constructed using the standard codes.\nTo further illustrate the mapping of response status, let’s assume that we have response_status2 which has the values 100 for ineligible, 200 for non-respondent, 300 for respondent, and 999 for unknown.\n\nresponse_status2 = np.repeat(100, full_sample[\"response_status\"].shape[0])\nresponse_status2[full_sample[\"response_status\"] == \"non-respondent\"] = 200\nresponse_status2[full_sample[\"response_status\"] == \"respondent\"] = 300\nresponse_status2[full_sample[\"response_status\"] == \"unknown\"] = 999\n\npd.crosstab(response_status2, full_sample[\"response_status\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresponse_status\nineligible\nnon-respondent\nrespondent\nunknown\n\n\nrow_0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n16\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n200\n0\n23\n0\n0\n\n\n300\n0\n0\n106\n0\n\n\n999\n0\n0\n0\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use response_status2, we need to map the values 100, 200, 300 and 999 to “in”, “rr”, “nr”, and “uk”.

The most common poststratification method consists of adjusting the sample weights to ensure that they sum to known control values from reliable souces by adjustment classes (domains). Poststratification classes can be formed using variables beyond the ones involved in the sampling design. For example, socio-economic variables such as age group, gender, race and education are often used to form poststratification classes/cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\npoststratifying to totals that are known to be out of date, and thus likely inaccurate and/or unreliable may not improve the estimate. Use this with caution.\n\n\nLet’s assume that we have a reliable external source e.g. a recent census that provides the number of households by region. The external source has the following control data: 3700 households for East, 1500 for North, 2800 for South and 6500 for West.\nWe use the method poststratify() to ensure that the poststratified sample weights (ps_weight) sum to the know control totals by region.

For example, WHO EPI vaccination surveys often postratify sample weights to ensure that relative sizes of strata reflect offcial statistics e.g. census data. In most cases, the strata are based on some administrative divisions.\nFor example, assume that according to census data that East contains 25% of the households, North contains 10%, South contains 20% and West contains 45%.

In this tutorial, we consider the generalized regression (GREG) class of calibration. Assume that we have \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\sum_{i \\in s} w_i y_i\\) and know population totals \\(\\mathbf{X} = (\\mathbf{X}_1, ..., \\mathbf{X}_p)^T\\) are available. Working under the model \\(Y_i | \\mathbf{x}_i = \\mathbf{x}^T_i \\mathbf{\\beta} + \\epsilon_i\\), the GREG estimator of the population total is\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}_{GR} = \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} + (\\mathbf{X} - \\hat{\\mathbf{X}})^T\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}\\) is the weighted least squares estimate of \\(\\mathbf{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{X}}\\) is the survey estimate of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). The essential of the GREG approach is, under the regression model, to find the adjusted weights \\(w^{*}_i\\) that are the closest to \\(w_i\\), to minimize \\(h(z) = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in s} c_i(w_i - z_i)}{w_i}\\).\nLet us simulate three auxiliary variables that is education, poverty and under_five (number of children under five in the household) and assume that we have the following control totals.\n\nTotal number of under five children: 6300 in the East, 4000 in the North, 6500 in the South and 14000 in the West.\nPoverty (Yes: in poverty / No: not in poverty)\n\n\n\nRegion  \nPoverty  \nNumber of households\n\n\n\n\nEast\nNo\n2600\n\n\n\nYes\n1200\n\n\nNorth\nNo\n1500\n\n\n\nYes\n200\n\n\nSouth\nNo\n1800\n\n\n\nYes\n1100\n\n\nWest\nNo\n4500\n\n\n\nYes\n2200\n\n\n\nEducation (Low: less than secondary, Medium: secondary completed, and High: More than secondary)\n\n\n\nRegion  \nEducation  \nNumber of households\n\n\n\n\nEast\nLow\n2000\n\n\n\nMedium\n1400\n\n\n\nHigh\n350\n\n\nNorth\nLow\n550\n\n\n\nMedium\n700\n\n\n\nHigh\n250\n\n\nSouth\nLow\n1300\n\n\n\nMedium\n1200\n\n\n\nHigh\n350\n\n\nWest\nLow\n2100\n\n\n\nMedium\n4000\n\n\n\nHigh\n500\n\n\n\n\n\nnp.random.seed(150)\nfull_sample[\"education\"] = np.random.choice(\n    (\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"), \n    size=150, \n    p=(0.40, 0.50, 0.10)\n    )\nfull_sample[\"poverty\"] = np.random.choice((0, 1), size=150, p=(0.70, 0.30))\nfull_sample[\"under_five\"] = np.random.choice(\n    (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), \n    size=150, \n    p=(0.05, 0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05)\n    )\n\nfull_sample[[\n    \"cluster\", \n    \"region\", \n    \"household\", \n    \"nr_weight\", \n    \"education\", \n    \"poverty\", \n    \"under_five\"\n    ]].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncluster\nregion\nhousehold\nnr_weight\neducation\npoverty\nunder_five\n\n\n\n\n0\n7\nNorth\n72\n49.464286\nHigh\n1\n1\n\n\n1\n7\nNorth\n73\n54.410714\nLow\n0\n3\n\n\n2\n7\nNorth\n75\n54.410714\nMedium\n0\n2\n\n\n3\n7\nNorth\n715\n54.410714\nMedium\n1\n2\n\n\n4\n7\nNorth\n722\n0.000000\nMedium\n0\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now will calibrate the nonreponse weight (nr_weight) to ensure that the estimated number of households in poverty is equal to 4,700 and the estimated total number of children under five is 30,8500.

Sample size calculations allow the survey implementers to collect enough data o achieve targeted precision levels. To do so, the sample size calculation should follow as close as possible the actual sampling design and take into account imperfections of survey implementations such as non response. Since sample sizes are calculated prior to implementing the survey, many of the input data needed to calculate sample sizes are obtained from previous experience and from reasonable assumptions.\nIn this tutorial, we illustrate the calculation and allocation of some common sample size methods.

In the example below, the user is testing whether the average mpg is equal to 20. Hence, the null hypothesis is H0: mean(mpg) = 20. There are three possible alternatives for this null hypotheses:\n\nHa: mean(mpg) &lt; 20 (less_than alternative)\nHa: mean(mpg) &gt; 20 (greater_than alternative)\nHa: mean(mpg) != 20 (not_equal alternative)\n\nAll three alternatives are automatically computed by the method compare().

    "section": "",
    "text": "Small area estimation (SAE) are useful techniques when the sample sizes are not sufficient to provide reliable direct domain estimates given the sampling design. In this tutorial, the direct estimates refer to estimates obtained from the design-based approach. It usually consists of applying adjusted design weights to the variable of interest to compute sample parameters as estimates of equivalent population parameters. When auxiliary information is available, we can use model assisted survey methods can be used to estimate population parameters.\nIn this tutorial, we will go futher and use modeling techniques to produce domains estimates. For the area level model, the modeling is done at the area level using generalized linear mixed models. The sections below shows how to use the EblupAreaModel class from the samplics package to produce area level estimates.\n\n\nTo illustrate the EblupAreaModel class, we will use the Milk Expenditure dataset used in Rao and Molina (2015). As mentioned in the book, this dataset was originally used by Arora and Lahiri (1997) and later by You and Chapman (2006). For the R users, this dataset is also used by the R package sae (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sae/index.html).\nThe Milk Expenditure data contains 43 observations on the average expenditure on fresh milk for the year 1989. The datasets has the following values: major area representing (major_area), small area (small_area), sample size (samp_size), direct survey estimates of average expenditure (direct_est), standard error of the direct estimate (std_error), and coefficient of variation of the direct estimates (coef_variance).\n\nfrom samplics.datasets import load_expenditure_milk\nfrom samplics.sae import EblupAreaModel\n\nfrom samplics.utils.types import FitMethod\n\n\n# Load Expenditure on Milk sample data\nmilk_exp_dict = load_expenditure_milk()\nmilk_exp = milk_exp_dict[\"data\"]\n\nnb_obs = 15\nprint(f\"First {nb_obs} observations of the Milk Expendure dataset\\n\")\nmilk_exp.tail(nb_obs)\n\nFirst 15 observations of the Milk Expendure dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmajor_area\nsmall_area\nsamp_size\ndirect_est\nstd_error\ncoef_var\n\n\n\n\n28\n4\n29\n238\n0.796\n0.106\n0.133\n\n\n29\n4\n30\n207\n0.565\n0.089\n0.158\n\n\n30\n4\n31\n165\n0.886\n0.225\n0.254\n\n\n31\n4\n32\n153\n0.952\n0.205\n0.215\n\n\n32\n4\n33\n210\n0.807\n0.119\n0.147\n\n\n33\n4\n34\n383\n0.582\n0.067\n0.115\n\n\n34\n4\n35\n255\n0.684\n0.106\n0.155\n\n\n35\n4\n36\n226\n0.787\n0.126\n0.160\n\n\n36\n4\n37\n224\n0.440\n0.092\n0.209\n\n\n37\n4\n38\n212\n0.759\n0.132\n0.174\n\n\n38\n4\n39\n211\n0.770\n0.100\n0.130\n\n\n39\n4\n40\n179\n0.800\n0.113\n0.141\n\n\n40\n4\n41\n312\n0.756\n0.083\n0.110\n\n\n41\n4\n42\n241\n0.865\n0.121\n0.140\n\n\n42\n4\n43\n205\n0.640\n0.129\n0.202\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the milk expenditure datasets, some of the coefficients of variation are not small which indicates unstability of the direct survey estimates. Hence, we can try to reduce the variability of the estimates by smoothing them through modeling. For illustration purpose, we will model the average expenditure on milk using the major areas as auxiliary variables.\nFirst, we use the method fit() to estimate the model parameters. The pandas’s method get_dummies() create a matrix with dummy values (0 and 1) from the categorical variable major_area.\n\narea = milk_exp[\"small_area\"]\nyhat = milk_exp[\"direct_est\"]\n\nimport pandas as pd\nX = pd.get_dummies(milk_exp[\"major_area\"],drop_first=True)\nsigma_e = milk_exp[\"std_error\"]\n\n## REML method\nfh_model_reml = EblupAreaModel(method=FitMethod.reml)\nfh_model_reml.fit(\n    yhat=yhat, X=X, area=area, error_std=sigma_e, intercept=True, tol=1e-8,\n)\n\n\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\nprint(f\"The estimated fixed effects are:\") \npprint(fh_model_reml.fixed_effects)\n\nThe estimated fixed effects are:\narray([ 0.96818899,  0.13278031,  0.22694622, -0.24130104])\n\n\n\nprint(\"The estimated standard error of the area random effects is:\")\npprint(fh_model_reml.re_std)\n\nThe estimated standard error of the area random effects is:\nnp.float64(0.1361996136767915)\n\n\n\nprint(\"The convergence statistics are:\")\npprint(fh_model_reml.convergence)\n\nThe convergence statistics are:\n{'achieved': np.True_,\n 'iterations': 9,\n 'precision': np.float64(1.979926775564084e-09)}\n\n\n\nprint(\"The goodness of fit statistics are:\") \npprint(fh_model_reml.goodness)\n\nThe goodness of fit statistics are:\n{'AIC': 30.80694881797811,\n 'BIC': 41.37414951213948,\n 'loglike': -9.403474408989055}\n\n\n\nfh_model_reml.predict(\n    X=X, area=area, intercept=True\n)\n\npprint(fh_model_reml.area_est)\n\n{np.int64(1): np.float64(1.0219705441558895),\n np.int64(2): np.float64(1.047601951445677),\n np.int64(3): np.float64(1.0679514263086396),\n np.int64(4): np.float64(0.7608165650758552),\n np.int64(5): np.float64(0.8461570437704427),\n np.int64(6): np.float64(0.9743727061135175),\n np.int64(7): np.float64(1.0584526719577583),\n np.int64(8): np.float64(1.0977762561870668),\n np.int64(9): np.float64(1.2215454894600388),\n np.int64(10): np.float64(1.1951460148495627),\n np.int64(11): np.float64(0.7852149191679922),\n np.int64(12): np.float64(1.2139462053925374),\n np.int64(13): np.float64(1.2096597208051414),\n np.int64(14): np.float64(0.9834964411924453),\n np.int64(15): np.float64(1.1864247095921692),\n np.int64(16): np.float64(1.1556981139181453),\n np.int64(17): np.float64(1.2263412506598241),\n np.int64(18): np.float64(1.2856489886705895),\n np.int64(19): np.float64(1.2363248408581458),\n np.int64(20): np.float64(1.2349601393920562),\n np.int64(21): np.float64(1.090301627484137),\n np.int64(22): np.float64(1.1923057228337588),\n np.int64(23): np.float64(1.1216467667588341),\n np.int64(24): np.float64(1.2230297218953323),\n np.int64(25): np.float64(1.1938054443945294),\n np.int64(26): np.float64(0.7627195896418987),\n np.int64(27): np.float64(0.7649551532185552),\n np.int64(28): np.float64(0.7338443880846521),\n np.int64(29): np.float64(0.7699295541643933),\n np.int64(30): np.float64(0.6134416233555452),\n np.int64(31): np.float64(0.7695560722792778),\n np.int64(32): np.float64(0.7958253116952814),\n np.int64(33): np.float64(0.7723188477263883),\n np.int64(34): np.float64(0.610230068308824),\n np.int64(35): np.float64(0.7001781896510536),\n np.int64(36): np.float64(0.7592788104101726),\n np.int64(37): np.float64(0.5298863364482942),\n np.int64(38): np.float64(0.743446678039724),\n np.int64(39): np.float64(0.7548996331139428),\n np.int64(40): np.float64(0.7701919657191105),\n np.int64(41): np.float64(0.7481164238473628),\n np.int64(42): np.float64(0.8040775158100446),\n np.int64(43): np.float64(0.6810868850580024)}\n\n\nWe can use the utility method to_dataframe() to output the estimates as a pandas dataframe.

Estimations obtained from such samples must reflect the random mechanism to ensure accurate calculations. samplics implements a set of sampling techniques for complex survey designs.\nSampling. Since the full population cannot be observed, a sample is selected to estimate population parameters of interest. The assumption is that the sample is representative of the population for the characteristics of interest. The sample size calculation and selection methods in samplics are:\n\nSample size calculation and allocation: Wald and Fleiss methods for proportions.\nEqual probability of selection: simple random sampling (SRS) and systematic selection (SYS)\nProbability proportional to size (PPS): Systematic, Brewer’s method, Hanurav-Vijayan method, Murphy’s method, and Rao-Sampford’s method.\n\nSample weighting. Sample weighting is the main mechanism used in surveys to formalize the representivity of the sample.

    "text": "The Unit Level model refers to a class of SAE techniques that fit the linear mixed model at the sampling unit level. As for the Area Level model, generalized linear mixed models are also the modeling framework for Unit Level model. In this case, given that the model is happening at the sub-area level, both the random effects and unit level standard errors can be estimated from the model. In this tutorial, we will predict the area level means which is a linear parameter.\n\n\nFor this example, we use the county crop data used by Battese, Harter, and Fuller (1988). The datasets contains 37 observations on areas under corn and under soybeans for each of the 12 counties in the north-central of Iowa. Each county was divided in segments and using interviews and LANDSAT satellite data, data on area used for corn and soybeans was obtained.

DHS, PHIA, MICS and other large scale surveys visit the selected clusters and construct the list of all households in the selected clusters.\nBefore starting the second stage selection, let us import the data from the first stage sampling information that is the first stage sample (psu_sample). For clarity, we explicitly import the packages and modules needed for this notebook.\n\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \n\nfrom samplics import SelectMethod\nfrom samplics.sampling import SampleSelection\n\n# Load the selected PSUs \npsu_frame = pd.read_csv(\"./psu_frame.csv\")\n\nIn this tutorial, we will simulate the second stage frame. For the simulation, assume that the psu frame was obtained from a previous census conducted several years before. We also assume that, the change in the number of households since the previous census follows a normal distribution with a mean equal to 5% higher than the census value and a variance of 0.15 times the number of households from the census. Under these assumptions, we generate the following second stage frame of households.

However, in strata 10, 16, 29, and 64, we listed more households than during than the census. And finally, we found less households in the remaining clusters than the census.\nNow that we have a second stage frame, let’s use samplics to calculate the probabilities of selection and to select a sample. The second stage sample size is 150 households and the strategy is to select 15 households per cluster.\n\nSSU (household) Probability of Selection\nThe second stage probabilities of selection are conditional on the first stage realization. For this stage, simple random selection (srs) and systematic selection(sys) are common methods used to select households. For this example, we use srs to select 15 households from each cluster. Conditionally to teh first stage, the second stage selection is a stratified srs where the clusters are the strata. More generally, we have that \\[\\begin{equation} p_{hij} = \\frac{m_{hi}}{M_{hi}^{'}} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(p_{hij}\\) is the conditional probability of selection for unit \\(j\\) from stratum \\(h\\) and cluster \\(j\\), \\(m_{hi}\\) and \\(M_{hi}^{'}\\) are the sample size and the number of secondary sampling units listed for stratum \\(h\\) and cluster \\(j\\), respectively.\nIn this scenario, sample size is the same in each stratum. Hence, the parameter sample_size does not need to be a Python dictionary; we will only provide 15 in the function call.\n\nstage2_design = SampleSelection(\n    method=SelectMethod.srs_wor, strat=True, wr=False\n)\n\nssu_frame[\"ssu_prob\"] = stage2_design.inclusion_probs(\n    ssu_frame[\"household\"], 15, ssu_frame[\"cluster\"]\n)\n\nssu_frame.sample(20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncluster\nregion\nhousehold\nssu_prob\n\n\n\n\n1438\n34\nEast\n34164\n0.004828\n\n\n2517\n52\nEast\n52606\n0.004828\n\n\n2943\n86\nWest\n86111\n0.004828\n\n\n3002\n86\nWest\n86170\n0.004828\n\n\n559\n10\nNorth\n10430\n0.004828\n\n\n1216\n29\nSouth\n29159\n0.004828\n\n\n2751\n64\nWest\n64220\n0.004828\n\n\n412\n10\nNorth\n10283\n0.004828\n\n\n2549\n64\nWest\n6418\n0.004828\n\n\n1508\n34\nEast\n34234\n0.004828\n\n\n1517\n45\nEast\n454\n0.004828\n\n\n2658\n64\nWest\n64127\n0.004828\n\n\n1072\n29\nSouth\n2915\n0.004828\n\n\n1074\n29\nSouth\n2917\n0.004828\n\n\n1669\n45\nEast\n45156\n0.004828\n\n\n1286\n34\nEast\n3412\n0.004828\n\n\n1162\n29\nSouth\n29105\n0.004828\n\n\n1051\n24\nSouth\n2467\n0.004828\n\n\n3085\n86\nWest\n86253\n0.004828\n\n\n2148\n52\nEast\n52237\n0.004828\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU (household) Selection\nThe second stage sample is selected from the SSU frame (ssu_frame) using the variable cluster as the strat variable.

Note that we include model assisted techniques such as the Generalized Regression (GREG) estimator in this category. These are often referred to as the direct estimates. In some applications, sample sizes are not large enough to produce reliable direct estimates for the domains of interest. In these situations, one possible way to improve the domain level estimates is to use SAE techniques which require availability of auxiliary information. Depending on the SAE method used, the auxiliary information needs to be available at the domains aggregated level or for non-sampled observations in the target population. SAE techniques produce modeled estimates of parameters of interest. There are two main categories of SAE methods that are the area level and the unit level, discussed in this tutorial.\nSection 1: Area level modeling  Section 2: Unit level modeling \nGeneralized linear mixed model are the statistical framework used to develop the SAE methods, for an introduction to GLMM see McCulloch, Searle, and Neuhaus (2008).

However, operational and cost constraints often result in much more complex mechanisms for selecting samples. Common use cases of complex sampling designs are the national household surveys such as The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), The Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS), The Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and many more. In the national household surveys, the sample is selected in stages. For example, at the first stage clusters of households are selected using probability proportional to size (pps) method, at the second stage households are selected from the sampled clusters, and at the final stage individuals are selected from households in the sample.\nIn this tutorial, we generate simulated data to illustrate the first and second stage selections of clusters and households, respectively.\nSection 1: Selection of PSUs  Section 2: Selection of SSUs \nFor a comprehensive review of sampling techniques, users may want to consult Brewer and Hanif (1983), Cochran (1977), Kish (1965), and Lohr (2021).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBrewer, K.

One common use case for replication-based methods is the estimation of non-linear parameters fow which Taylor-based approximation may not be accurate enough. Another use case is when the number of primary sampling units selected per stratum is small (low degree of freedom).\nIn this tutorial, we will explore creating replicate weights using the class ReplicateWeight. Three replication methods have been implemented: balanced repeated replication (BRR) including the Fay-BRR, bootstrap and jackknife. The replicate method of interest is specified when initializing the class by using the parameter method. The parameter method takes the values “bootstrap”, “brr”, or “jackknife”.

The groups are then threated as independent replicates of the the sample design. A special case is when the sample is split into two half samples in each stratum. This design is suitable to many survey designs where only two psus are selected by stratum. In practice, one of the psu is asigned to the first random group and the other psu is assign to the second group. The sample weights are double for one group (say the first one) and the sample weights in the other group are set to zero. To ensure that the replicates are independent, we use hadamard matrices to assign the random groups.\n\nimport scipy\nscipy.linalg.hadamard(8)\n\narray([[ 1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1],\n       [ 1, -1,  1, -1,  1, -1,  1, -1],\n       [ 1,  1, -1, -1,  1,  1, -1, -1],\n       [ 1, -1, -1,  1,  1, -1, -1,  1],\n       [ 1,  1,  1,  1, -1, -1, -1, -1],\n       [ 1, -1,  1, -1, -1,  1, -1,  1],\n       [ 1,  1, -1, -1, -1, -1,  1,  1],\n       [ 1, -1, -1,  1, -1,  1,  1, -1]])\n\n\nIn our example, we have 10 psus. If we do not have explicit stratification then replicate() will group the clusters into 5 strata (2 per stratum). In this case, the smallest number of replicates possible using the hadamard matrix is 8.\nThe result below shows that replicate() created 5 strata by grouping clusters 7 and 10 in the first stratum, clusters 16 and 24 in the second stratum, and so on. We can achieve the same result by providing setting strat=True and providing the stratum variable to replicate().\n\nbrr = ReplicateWeight(method=RepMethod.brr, strat=False)\nbrr_wgt = brr.replicate(\n    samp_weight=full_sample[\"design_weight\"], \n    psu=full_sample[\"cluster\"]\n    )\n\nbrr_wgt.drop_duplicates().head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_stratum\n_psu\n_samp_weight\n_brr_wgt_1\n_brr_wgt_2\n_brr_wgt_3\n_brr_wgt_4\n_brr_wgt_5\n_brr_wgt_6\n_brr_wgt_7\n_brr_wgt_8\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n7\n46.166667\n0.000000\n92.333333\n0.000000\n92.333333\n0.000000\n92.333333\n0.000000\n92.333333\n\n\n15\n1\n10\n50.783333\n101.566667\n0.000000\n101.566667\n0.000000\n101.566667\n0.000000\n101.566667\n0.000000\n\n\n30\n2\n16\n62.149123\n0.000000\n0.000000\n124.298246\n124.298246\n0.000000\n0.000000\n124.298246\n124.298246\n\n\n45\n2\n24\n58.940741\n117.881481\n117.881481\n0.000000\n0.000000\n117.881481\n117.881481\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n60\n3\n29\n65.702778\n0.000000\n131.405556\n131.405556\n0.000000\n0.000000\n131.405556\n131.405556\n0.000000\n\n\n75\n3\n34\n75.661566\n151.323133\n0.000000\n0.000000\n151.323133\n151.323133\n0.000000\n0.000000\n151.323133\n\n\n90\n4\n45\n85.398025\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n170.796049\n170.796049\n170.796049\n170.796049\n\n\n105\n4\n52\n85.520635\n171.041270\n171.041270\n171.041270\n171.041270\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n120\n5\n64\n218.893889\n0.000000\n437.787778\n0.000000\n437.787778\n437.787778\n0.000000\n437.787778\n0.000000\n\n\n135\n5\n86\n213.491667\n426.983333\n0.000000\n426.983333\n0.000000\n0.000000\n426.983333\n0.000000\n426.983333\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extension of BRR is the Fay’s method.

There are two main python classes for tabulation i.e. Tabulation() for one-way tables and CrossTabulation() for two-way tables.\n\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\nfrom samplics.datasets import load_birth, load_nhanes2\nfrom samplics.categorical import Tabulation, CrossTabulation\n\nfrom samplics.utils.types import PopParam\n\n\nOne-way tabulation\nThe birth dataset has four variables: region, agecat, birthcat, and pop. The variables agecat and birthcat are categirical. By default, pandas read them as numerical, because they are coded with numerical values. We use dtype=\"string\" or dtype=\"category\" to ensure that pandas codes the variables as categorical responses.\n\n# Load Birth sample data\nbirth_dict = load_birth()\nbirth = birth_dict[\"data\"].astype(\n    {\"region\": str, \"agecat\": str, \"birthcat\": str}\n)\n\nregion = birth[\"region\"]\nagecat = birth[\"agecat\"]\nbirthcat = birth[\"birthcat\"]\n\nbirth.head(15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregion\nagecat\nbirthcat\npop\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n1.0\n28152\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1.0\n103101\n\n\n2\n1\n1\n1.0\n113299\n\n\n3\n1\n1\n1.0\n112028\n\n\n4\n1\n1\n1.0\n99588\n\n\n5\n1\n1\n1.0\n22356\n\n\n6\n1\n1\n1.0\n102926\n\n\n7\n1\n1\n1.0\n12627\n\n\n8\n1\n1\n1.0\n112885\n\n\n9\n1\n1\n1.0\n150297\n\n\n10\n1\n1\n1.0\n52785\n\n\n11\n1\n1\n2.0\n109108\n\n\n12\n1\n1\n2.0\n87768\n\n\n13\n1\n1\n2.0\n175886\n\n\n14\n1\n1\n2.0\n107847\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen requesting a table, the user can set param=\"count\" which results in a tabulation with counts in the cells while param=\"proportion leads to cells with proportions. The expression Tabulation(\"count\") instantiates the class Tabulation() which has a method tabulate() to produce the table.\n\nbirth_count = Tabulation(param=PopParam.count)\nbirth_count.tabulate(birthcat, remove_nan=True)\n\nprint(birth_count)\n\n\nTabulation of birthcat\n Number of strata: 1\n Number of PSUs: 923\n Number of observations: 923\n Degrees of freedom: 922.00\n\n variable category  PopParam.count  stderror   lower_ci   upper_ci\nbirthcat      1.0           240.0 13.333695 213.832087 266.167913\nbirthcat      2.0           450.0 15.193974 420.181215 479.818785\nbirthcat      3.0           233.0 13.204959 207.084737 258.915263\n\n\n\nWhen remove_nan=False, the numpy and pandas special values NaNs, respectively np.nan and NaN, are treated as valid categories and added to the tables as shown below\n\nbirth_count = Tabulation(param=PopParam.count)\nbirth_count.tabulate(birthcat, remove_nan=False)\n\nprint(birth_count)\n\n\nTabulation of birthcat\n Number of strata: 1\n Number of PSUs: 956\n Number of observations: 956\n Degrees of freedom: 955.00\n\n variable category  PopParam.count  stderror   lower_ci   upper_ci\nbirthcat      1.0           240.0 13.414066 213.675550 266.324450\nbirthcat      2.0           450.0 15.441157 419.697485 480.302515\nbirthcat      3.0           233.0 13.281448 206.935807 259.064193\nbirthcat      nan            33.0  5.647499  21.917060  44.082940\n\n\n\nThe data associated with the tabulation are stored in nested python dictionaries. The higher level key is the variable name and the inner keys are the response categories. Each of the last four columns shown above are stored in separated dictionaries. Two of those dictionaries for the counts and standard errors shown below.\n\nprint(\"\\nThe designed-based estimated counts are:\")\npprint(birth_count.point_est)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe designed-based standard errors are:\")\npprint(birth_count.stderror)\n\n\nThe designed-based estimated counts are:\n{'birthcat': {'1.0': 240.0, '2.0': 450.0, '3.0': 233.0, 'nan': 33.0}}\n\nThe designed-based standard errors are:\n{'birthcat': {'1.0': 13.414066228212423,\n              '2.0': 15.441156672080215,\n              '3.0': 13.281447911983973,\n              'nan': 5.647498635475388}}\n\n\nSometimes, the user may want to run multiple one-way tables of several variables. In this case, the user can provide the data as a two-dimensional dataframe where each column represents one categorical variable. In this situation, each categorical variable is tabulated individually then combined into Python dictionaries.\n\nbirth_count2 = Tabulation(param=PopParam.count)\nbirth_count2.tabulate(\n    birth[[\"region\", \"agecat\", \"birthcat\"]], \n    remove_nan=True\n    )\n\nprint(birth_count2)\n\n\nTabulation of region\n Number of strata: 1\n Number of PSUs: 923\n Number of observations: 923\n Degrees of freedom: 922.00\n\n variable category  PopParam.count  stderror   lower_ci   upper_ci\n  region        1           166.0 11.718335 143.003340 188.996660\n  region        2           284.0 14.136507 256.257795 311.742205\n  region        3           250.0 13.594733 223.321002 276.678998\n  region        4           256.0 13.698320 229.117716 282.882284\n  agecat        1           507.0 15.439224 476.701278 537.298722\n  agecat        2           316.0 14.552307 287.441809 344.558191\n  agecat        3           133.0 10.705921 111.990152 154.009848\nbirthcat      1.0           240.0 13.333695 213.832087 266.167913\nbirthcat      2.0           450.0 15.193974 420.181215 479.818785\nbirthcat      3.0           233.0 13.204959 207.084737 258.915263\n\n\n\nTwo of the associated Python dictionaries are shown below. The structure of the inner dictionaries remain the same but additional key-value pairs are added to represent the several categorical variables.\n\nprint(\"\\nThe designed-based estimated counts are:\")\npprint(birth_count2.point_est)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe designed-based standard errors are:\")\npprint(birth_count2.stderror)\n\n\nThe designed-based estimated counts are:\n{'agecat': {'1': 507.0, '2': 316.0, '3': 133.0},\n 'birthcat': {'1.0': 240.0, '2.0': 450.0, '3.0': 233.0},\n 'region': {'1': 166.0, '2': 284.0, '3': 250.0, '4': 256.0}}\n\nThe designed-based standard errors are:\n{'agecat': {'1': 15.439223863518956,\n            '2': 14.552306810531896,\n            '3': 10.705921442206717},\n 'birthcat': {'1.0': 13.333694861331473,\n              '2.0': 15.193973574144477,\n              '3.0': 13.204958642679685},\n 'region': {'1': 11.718334853030456,\n            '2': 14.136507266518636,\n            '3': 13.594732580183479,\n            '4': 13.698320300591291}}\n\n\nIn the example above, we used pandas series and dataframes with labelled variables.

    "text": "In the cells below, we illustrate a simple example of sample size calculation in the context of household surveys using stage sampling designs. Let’s assume that we want to calculate sample size for a vaccination survey in Senegal. We want to stratify the sample by administrative region. We will use the 2017 Senegal Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) to get an idea of the vaccination coverage rates for some main vaccine-doses. Below, we show coverage rates of hepatitis B birth dose (hepB0) vaccine, first and third dose of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP), first dose of measles containing vaccine (MCV1) and coverage of basic vaccination. Basic vaccination refers to the 12-23 months old children that received BCG vaccine, three doses of DTP containing vaccine, three doses of polio vaccine, and the first dose of measles containing vaccine.The table below shows the 2017 Senegal DHS vaccination coverage of a few vaccine-doses for children aged 12 to 23 months old.\nThe 2017 Senegal DHS data collection happened from April to December 2018. Therefore, the data shown in the table represent children born from October 2016 to December 2017. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will assume that these vaccine coverage rates still hold. Furthermore, we will use the basic vaccination coverage rates to calculate sample size.\nfrom samplics.sampling import SampleSize",

    "section": "Wald method",
    "text": "Wald method\nThe first step is to create and object using the SampleSize class with the parameter of interest, the sample size calculation method, and the stratification status. In this example, we want to calculate sample size for proportions, using wald method for a stratified design. This is achived with the following snippet of code.\n\nSampleSize(\n    param=\"proportion\", method=\"wald\", strat=True\n)\n\nBecause, we are using a stratified sample design, it is best to specify the expected coverage levels by stratum. If the information is not available then aggregated values can be used across the strata. The 2017 Senegal DHS published the coverage rates by region hence we have the information available by stratum. To provide the informmation to Samplics we use the python dictionaries as follows\n\nexpected_coverage = {\n    \"Dakar\": 0.849,\n    \"Ziguinchor\": 0.809,\n    \"Diourbel\": 0.682,\n    \"Saint-Louis\": 0.806,\n    \"Tambacounda\": 0.470,\n    \"Kaolack\": 0.797,\n    \"Thies\": 0.834,\n    \"Louga\": 0.678,\n    \"Fatick\": 0.766,\n    \"Kolda\": 0.637,\n    \"Matam\": 0.687,\n    \"Kaffrine\": 0.766,\n    \"Kedougou\": 0.336,\n    \"Sedhiou\": 0.742,\n}\n\nNow, we want to calculate the sample size with desired precision of 0.07 which means that we want the expected vaccination coverage rates to have 7% half confidence intervals e.g. expected rate of 90% will have a confidence interval of [83%, 97%]. Note that the desired precision can be specified by stratum in a similar way as the target coverage using a python dictionary.\nGiven that information, we can calculate the sample size using SampleSize class as follows.\n\nfrom samplics.utils.types import SizeMethod, PopParam\n\n# Declare the sample size calculation parameters\nsen_vaccine_wald = SampleSize(\n    param=PopParam.prop, method=SizeMethod.wald, strat=True\n)\n\n# calculate the sample size\nsen_vaccine_wald.calculate(target=expected_coverage, half_ci=0.07)\n\n# show the calculated sample size\nprint(f\"\\nCalculated sample sizes by stratum: \")\nsen_vaccine_wald.samp_size\n\n\nCalculated sample sizes by stratum: \n\n\n{'Dakar': 101,\n 'Ziguinchor': 122,\n 'Diourbel': 171,\n 'Saint-Louis': 123,\n 'Tambacounda': 196,\n 'Kaolack': 127,\n 'Thies': 109,\n 'Louga': 172,\n 'Fatick': 141,\n 'Kolda': 182,\n 'Matam': 169,\n 'Kaffrine': 141,\n 'Kedougou': 175,\n 'Sedhiou': 151}\n\n\nSampleSize calculates the sample sizes and store the in teh samp_size attributes which is a python dictinary object.

    "text": "The sample weighting is the mechanism that allows us to generalize the results from the sample to the target population. The design/base weights are obtained from the final probability of selection as their inverse. In large scale surveys, design weights are adjusted to account for non-response, for extreme values, or to ensure that auxiliary variables benchmark to known controls.\nThe weighting tutorial is in two parts. The first part discusses several weight adjustments methods e.g. non-response adjustment, poststratification, calibration. The second part of the tutorial walks the user through the creation of replicate weights using Booststrap, Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR), and Jackknife methods.\nSection 1: Sample weight adjustments  Section 2: Replicates weights \nValliant, R. and Dever, J.
