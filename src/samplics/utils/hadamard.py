"""computes Hadamard matrices.
A Hadamard matrix is a square matrix whose entries are either +1 or âˆ’1 and whose rows are mutually orthogonal.The Hadamard matrix is used to derive the BRR replicate weights. It is conjectured that
a Hadamard matrix exist for all n divisible by 4. However, the *hadarmard(n)* functions from
*scipy.linalg* only provides the matrix for n that are power of 2. Hence, in this module,
additional Hadamard matrices are implemented. For example, *scipy.linalg.hadamard()* can provide a matrix for n = 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc. The module add Hadamard matrices for n = 12, 20, 24, 28, and some additional to come.

In appendix A, Wolter, K. M. (1985) [#w1985]_ provides a list of Hadamard matrices for all
n multiple of 4 up to 100 which should be sufficient for most applications. Note that this is
this reference is for the first edition of the book which explicitly provides the hadamard
matrices. Above that, the scipy function can be used. Also, more Hadamard matrices can be
found at: http://neilsloane.com/hadamard/
